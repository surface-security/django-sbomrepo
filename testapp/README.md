# TestApp

The purpose of this directoy for Django apps is to fake a Django site that installs the plugin and has it there for demonstration purposes (how to install and setup), as well as to run test suites.

This app does not have any special requirements, other than installing the dependencies needed (Django + the ones from the app we're deploying).
