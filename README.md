# Django App

This template should be used for Django Applications open sourced under the Surface Security context and organization.

This template contains some sample workflows, as well as a typical structure of these type of repositories, following companion documentation to help you set it up and get started.

# Usage

READMEs should have extensive and detailed descriptions of how the app should be used, ideally followed with screenshots and/or videos demonstrating the purpose of the app and or service offered.

This section should cover everything related to **the end user**, from installing, to descriminate configuration variables users can tweak (if applicable).

# Contributing

READMEs should also provide instructions on how to contribute. How to install a development environment, how to run tests, and so on.
